## Contributing to Inkl

We're excited you're interested in contributing to Inkl! We value your help in making Inkl the best personalized news reader it can be.

This guide outlines the contribution process for Inkl, including identifying and reporting bugs, getting your code reviewed, and adhering to coding conventions.

**Before You Code:**

* **Identify and Report Issues:**  Encountered a bug or have a suggestion for improvement? Open an issue on the project's GitHub repository!  This helps us track known issues and prioritize them effectively.
* **Provide Clear Descriptions:**  When opening an issue, be as detailed as possible.  Describe the problem you're facing, expected behavior, and any relevant steps to reproduce it. This allows us to understand the issue efficiently and assign it to the appropriate contributor.
* **Engage in Discussion:**  Issues are a collaborative space.  Respond to questions from maintainers and consider suggestions from other contributors.  Working together leads to better solutions!

**Getting Your Code Approved:**

* **Once an Issue is Assigned:**  If a maintainer assigns the issue to you, that signifies their approval for you to proceed with a code fix.  Feel free to ask clarifying questions before diving in.
* **Fork, Clone, and Code:**  Follow the usual Git workflow:  fork the repository, clone your fork locally, and make your changes. 
* **Write Unit Tests:**  We highly encourage writing unit tests for your changes to ensure functionality and prevent regressions in the future.
* **Submit a Pull Request:**  When your fix is complete and tested, submit a pull request to the main repository.  Include clear and concise descriptions of your changes and reference the related issue in the pull request description.

**Code Conventions and Style:**

* **Maintain Readability:**  Inkl adheres to a consistent code style for better readability and maintainability.  Consider using code formatters like ESLint or Prettier to enforce these guidelines. 
* **Follow Common Practices:**  Adhere to common JavaScript coding conventions like using semicolons and consistent indentation. 

**Additional Notes:**

* We maintain an open and respectful tone in our codebase and communication.
* Feel free to reach out to maintainers if you have any questions or need guidance.
